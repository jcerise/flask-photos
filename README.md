Flask Photos
------------
This is a simple photo gallery web app that is completely powered by Dropbox. The idea is thus: use the webapp to
create directories in a specified application directory on a Dropbox account, upload photos to said newly created
directory, and then display them in a lightbox gallery format on the webapp, publicly available to anyone. This is
more an experiment than anything, and there are a few potential issues with it, namely, I don't know what Dropbox's
API call limit is, and I'm not sure how fast this will begin approaching that.

Anyways, I'm using this as an excuse to play with Flask, so, take it for what it is.
